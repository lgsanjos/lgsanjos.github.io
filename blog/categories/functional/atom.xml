    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a short post, it is more to advice who is learning <strong>functional programming</strong>, this idea came to my mind after me and a friend of mine were talking about some classic problems and the functional approachs to solve them, after a while we decided to go and solve some stuff on <a href="http://www.4clojure.com">4Clojure</a> which is really fun and I&rsquo;m here to recommend it to you.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>If you never been there, it&rsquo;s a platform that presents you small problems as it introduces you to the Clojure language. After acomplishing each exercise you can see the other user&rsquo;s solution. So progressively you learn clojure with the tutorial but also check what real experienced developers do and how their code look like.</p>

<p>To learn each new command it&rsquo;s a good ideia to check out on the official documentation <a href="http://clojure.org/documentation">here</a> and this <a href="http://clojure.org/cheatsheet">cheatsheet</a> with some code samples is very usefull too.</p>

<p>You can follow me and check some of my answers. <a href="https://www.4clojure.com/user/lgsanjos">Here</a> is my profile and on github I have published some of my answers on <a href="https://github.com/lgsanjos/4clojure_exercies">this</a> repo.</p>
