Side notes

###Part1:
####Fundamental techniques in handling people

1. If you want to gather honey, don't kick over the beehive
	* Don't criticize people instead incentive them to do differently.
	* Assume poeple their best in that situation because we never know the whole context to judge.
	* "Don't criticize them. They are just what we would be under similar cricumstances."

2. The big secret of dealing with people
  * Sigmund Freud said "Everything you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great."
	* The only way to make people do something is making them wanting to do so.
	* Watch out for friends that flatters you. Flattery is telling a person precisely what he/she thinks of himself/herself.
  * Give sincere appreciation. 
3. He who can do this has the whole wolrd with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way
  * People are interested in what they want.
	* The only way to influence people is to talk about what they want and how to get it.
	* if there is any secret of success it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see thing from that person's angle as well as from your own.

###Part2: 
####Six ways to make people like you

1. Do this and you'll be welcome anywhere
  * Dog is the only animal which does not work for living. It get's everthing by giving love.
	* The most used word is "I".
	* "its the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest diffculties in life and provides the greatest injury to others."
  * Poeple are deeply interest in their own world, if you care about it too they will listen and care about you.
	* Become genuinely interested in other people.

2. A simple way to make a good first impression
  * Hapiness is always welcome anywhere.
	* Greet and approach people with a smile and it helps people to associate you as someone who brings hapiness and wellness.
