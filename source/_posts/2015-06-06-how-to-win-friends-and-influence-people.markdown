	* Smile even when on the phone. Smiles influences your voice.
	* Never foce a smile. It's completely noticeable and creates a worse impression.
	* Greet and approach people with a smile and it helps people to associate you as someone who brings hapiness and wellness.

###Part 3: 
####How to win people to your way of thinking

1. You can't win an argument
  * The best way to approach an argument is to avoid the argument.
	* If you proven someone is wrong it will hurt their pride and feeling of importance, it's not constructive.
	* A conflict is never ended by an argument but by tact and diplomacy.
	* When someone argues and bring some different point of view, recognizes and show appreciation to minimize the stress.
	* When people yell at each other, it's not communication it's just noise.
	* Look for areas of agreement.
	* Divergent ideas usually means different points of view, try to understand the other's point of view not to prove you are right.
	* When you disagree and an argument seems near, listen first. Do try to understand deeply what the other is saying instead of judge as wrong.

2. A sure way of making enemies - And how to avoid it
  * A sure way of making enemies is telling they are wrong, know nothing. It deeply hurts the feeling of importance and self pride.
	* Even when sure of what you are going to say, offer the idea as a suggestion never pushes it. When an idea is pushed it means "I'm better than you". 
	* Respect other's opinions and treat them courteously.
  * Always use diplomacy.

3. If you are wrong, admit it
  * Admit it quickly and emphatically
  * Be humble and people will have a forgiving attitude towards you.
  
4. A drop of honey
  * “So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend”
	* Start negotiation in a friendly way and it will influence on the other's judgment.
	* We like to help friends and people who care about us, it's clever to be friendly with people so in need a help is more likely to come.

5. The secret of socrates
  * When starting a conversation, talk about in common points not on divergences. Emphasizes what you have in common.
	* This feeling of being right is very powerful and should take place before the divergences.
	* Try to keep your opponent saying "yes, yes... yes" instead of "no". Once a "no" takes place, a pearson will try to remain consistent with that for sake of pride.

6. The safety valve in handling complaints
  * When complaining people have a stream of thoughts that wants to talk about. Never interrupt them, listen everything first, wait the other's person finishes first.
	* Encourage them to express themselves.
	* Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.

7. How to get cooperation
  * People like to buy but not to be sold. Most people prefer to feel that they are actiong on their own ideas not on what were sold to them.
	* Let the others take credits for ideas.
	* Ask for theirs ideas or advice about something.

8. A formula that will work wonders for you
  * Do not condemn someone for being wrong.
	* Put yourself in other's shoes and try to figure out why they act how they do or why they would say something like they did.
	* If there is any secret of success it lies on see through someone's point of view as clear as ours point.

9. What everybody wants
  * Three-fourths of the people you meet want sympathy. Give it to them and they will love you.
	* Before you speak back to someone who has offended you or is debating you, remember to try and react differently than just anyone would. Respond how a wise person would react, not just any fool.

10. An appeal that everybody likes
  * J. Pierpont Morgan said: "Rverybody usually has two reasons for doing anything: one that sounds good, and then their real reason.".
	* Use noble motives that impacts other people. Like mother's love, children education, environment or any noble cause that people share.

11. The movies do it. Tv Does it. Why don't you do it?
  * Drama. Dramatize your ideas it turns out to be more interesting and get more attention.

12. When nothing else works, try this
  * People love the chance to express themselves, their worth, and to show their importance. So listen to them.
	* Keep the door open to people approach you.
	* Stimulate competition so people will try to outreach to prove themselves. It's better than pointing fingers with no constructive meaning.

###Part 4:
#### Be a leader: How to change people without giving offense or arousing resentment

1. If you must find fault, this is the way to begin
  * Praise before the bad news. 
	* If you are firing someone tell he/she the bright side first and sinceres praise before firing itself. It avoid the feeloing that the decision were personal. 
	* Imagine a dentist about to perform drilling. Yes, the patient is about to get drilled, but the dentist gives him Novacain to dull the pain.

2. How to criticize - and not be hated for it
  * It's common to start with a sincere praise followed by a "but". When heard this poeple might doubt about the praises. It's better to use the word "and" and continue with no direct criticism instead encourage to the right way
	* The praise now comes off as sincere and may make that person want to live up to our expectations.

3. Talk about you own mistakes first
  * It feels a lot better to hear someone talk about their faults and kind of “get down on your level” in a sense before they point out yours.
	* Admiting your failures is a humble act. Poeple will feel safe to share theirs as well.
	* Also it encourages people to analyze their failures and change their behavior.

4. No one likes to take orders
  * Giving suggestions instead of giving orders is much more effective and seve person's pride.
	* Asking questions instead of ordering make people to feel they are participating in the decisions and are effective.
