This is a short post, it is more to advice who is learning **functional programming**, this idea came to my mind after me and a friend of mine were talking about some classic problems and the functional approachs to solve them, after a while we decided to go and solve some stuff on [4Clojure](http://www.4clojure.com) which is really fun and I'm here to recommend it to you.

If you never been there, it's a platform that presents you small problems as it introduces you to the Clojure language. After acomplishing each exercise you can see the other user's solution. So progressively you learn clojure with the tutorial but also check what real experienced developers do and how their code look like.

To learn each new command it's a good ideia to check out on the official documentation [here](http://clojure.org/documentation) and this [cheatsheet](http://clojure.org/cheatsheet) with some code samples is very usefull too.

You can follow me and check some of my answers. [Here](https://www.4clojure.com/user/lgsanjos) is my profile and on github I have published some of my answers on [this](https://github.com/lgsanjos/4clojure_exercies) repo.
